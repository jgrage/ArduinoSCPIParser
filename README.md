# Arduino SCPI parser

This is a fork of the Arduino SCPI parser from Lachlan Gunn's [Open Instrument Control](https://github.com/LachlanGunn/oic).  
The file hierarchy has been modified to be able to import the library directly from github into a platformio project. Files for the PC port and the AD9835 chip have been removed.
